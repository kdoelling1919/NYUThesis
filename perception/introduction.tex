People think about perception a lot \citep{Wertheimer:1923}.
Sometimes they even perceive equations like this!

\begin{equation}
  \frac {E}{a^2} = \frac {MC^2}{b^2 + c^2}
  \label{eq:examp}
\end{equation}
\myequations{Equation, maybe?}

From equation \eqref{eq:examp}, we can see that equations are indeed perceptible.
