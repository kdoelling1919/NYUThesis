\subsection{Participants}
One participant was studied, the author, in an exercise of introspection. He is right-handed, 29 years old and is a solid 7. This was not approved by the IRB.

\subsection{Stimuli {\&} Task}
To engage the participant in a feeling of cognitive dissonance, we forced him to write a thesis about cognitive dissonance. The results were surprisingly effective.
