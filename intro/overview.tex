\subsection{How to write a thesis}
The work presented here is a thesis template made using \LaTeX.
It is organized into a series of folders each of which corresponds to one chapter of the dissertation.
Infrastructure files are maintained in the root directory.
The template works with a Makefile which will compile the latex files into a single pdf. See the README file for usage.
