Setup
-----
Make sure you have [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org) at a minimum.
For Mac users, [MacTeX](http://tug.org/mactex/) is an easy-to-use installer.

For markdown writers:

  If you are writing in markdown, make sure you have [pandoc](http://pandoc.org)
  installed prior to compiling your file, otherwise it won't work.


Usage
-----

Edit main.tex and *.markdown files.

  e.g. within preamble.tex, modify `\addbibresource{/path/to/file}` with bibtex file.

To compile the thesis:

  $ make pdf

To compile one chapter into pdf:
