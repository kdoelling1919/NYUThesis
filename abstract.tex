In this text, you will find the abstract of my dissertation.
You will notice that I write each sentence on a different line in the .tex file.
And yet when you make the pdf, it will look normal.
The advantage of this is better version tracking if you track changes with git.
The alternative would be to have a .tex line house a whole paragraph.
In that case, if you make an edit, git will mark the whole paragraph as deleted and replaced.
This makes it quite difficult to find the change you made previously, when you are comparing versions. Taken together, we find it best to break it down to individual sentences.
As long as you separated each paragraph by an empty line, the text will look the same on compiling.
