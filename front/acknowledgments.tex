I would like to acknowledge the many people who have contributed to this template, in advance of this: Marc Millstone who created the thesis template which I have only very lightly edited.
Also, Aaron Bornstein who shared this template amongst the Cognition \& Perception department and Teon Brooks who maintained its use for a couple years.
